                This prospect Privacy & Cookies Policy (this “Privacy Policy”) explains how your personal information is collected, used and disclosed by prospect, Inc. and the prospect affiliates listed in the “Controllers and Contacting Us” section below (“prospect”, “us”, “we” or “our”) and how we collect information through the use of cookies and related technologies. It also tells you how you can access and update your personal information and describes the data protection rights that may be available under your country’s or state’s laws, including (in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), Switzerland and the UK), a right to object to some processing that we carry out or, where we rely on consent, how to withdraw that consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Privacy Policy applies to personal information we obtain from or about you when you (i) visit all Internet sites operated by prospect that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”); (ii) log in and use the apps or the platform operated by prospect that interact with our products (e.g. Listings, Hearsay Social, Reviews, Pages, Relate, Search, prospect Social, collectively, the “Products”); (iii) interact with our social media pages and advertisements, customer services, communications, webinars or blogs; (iv) participate in our events and demonstrations; or (v) visit our offices.

                Unless otherwise specified, we act as the “controller” for the data processing operations described in this Privacy Policy. Where we process personal information on behalf of our customers or resellers and act as a “processor” (also called a “service provider” in respect of certain processing in connection with our Products), this Privacy Policy does not apply. In these circumstances, the customer or reseller will be the “controller” as they decide how or why your personal information is handled and will be responsible for ensuring that they have complied with all applicable data protection legislation and providing you with their own privacy policies to allow us to process such personal information on their behalf. Our processing activity as service provider and processor is governed by the contracts we have with our customers/resellers. Under the terms of those contracts, we will direct any data subject request you make to us for personal information we process as a processor to the relevant controller. Please contact the relevant customer or reseller directly if you have questions regarding their data collection practices or the rights available to you in this regard.
            </p>
            <p>
                We may provide additional information about our privacy practices at other points, for example, when we ask you to provide personal information in connection with a particular service or when you apply for a job, and where this will help us provide more relevant and timely information.
            </p>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to make changes to our practices and this Privacy Policy at any time and at our sole discretion. If we change the way we handle your personal information, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify you as appropriate. Changes, additions, or deletions will be effective when posted, unless stated otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, the term “personal information” shall be deemed to encompass the term “personal data” to the extent that the meaning assigned to it by applicable data protection laws, including (but not limited to) information that identifies an individual directly or indirectly, on its own or in conjunction with other information.
